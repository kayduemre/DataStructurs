Using the ITU cloud storage service
-----------------------------------

ITU offers the Kovan cloud storage service that you can use for backing up
and accessing your files from various devices. You can use it through
`its web site`_ or via a client application.

The recommended Linux installation already includes the client application
"ownCloud desktop sync client" which you can find under the "Accessories"
category. Other Ubuntu based installations can obtain it by installing
the package ``owncloud-client``. The first time you run it, you will need
to supply the following information:

- Server Address: ``https://kovan.itu.edu.tr``
- Username: *your ITU user name*
- Password: *your ITU password*

You can also install the "İTÜ Kovan" app from `Google Play`_ to access
your files from Android mobile devices.
